# Computational Intelligence Solutions
I have used local search, particle swarm optimization and evolutionary algorithm to solve some computationally challenging problems. This means that it would take too long to find the best solution by using normal means (problem size increases exponentially). These problems are solved by algorithms which keep improving themselves and find the best possible solution to the problem within the time frame which should be as good as the best solution.
